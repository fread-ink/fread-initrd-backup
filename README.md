This is a backup of everything automatically downloaded by the [fread-initrd](https://github.com/fread-ink/fread-initrd) scripts. Kept here in case the original sources become unavailable.

To use this, manually extract the `buildroot-2016.02.tar.bz2`, then copy the `dl/` directory into the resulting `buildroot-2016.02/` directory and move the `buildroot-2016.02/` directory into the fread-initrd directory.
